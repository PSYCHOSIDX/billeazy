# ELECTRICITY BILLING SYSTEM 

 

## PROBLEM STATEMENT 

As part of this project, attendees have to create an electricity billing system for all the consumers of North Goa.  

This billing module should be able to generate bills for all the consumers based on the meter reading recorded from their premise. Meter readings that are captured by the field officers using a meter reading device can then be connected to the billing module to get the data in a flat file. This flat file can then be loaded into the system to store the data into the database. The billing should be done based on the consumer type (Domestic, Commercial or industrial), Sanctioned load & the subsidy provided by the government. 

 

## OBJECTIVE 1 

The key electricity distributor within Goa 

Electricity Department: The Electricity Department was created as a Govt. Department in the year 1963. The Electricity Department is the only licensee in the state of Goa for transmission and distribution of Electrical Energy. 

The Department does not have its own generation and purchases power from the Central Sector Power Stations of the National Thermal Power Corporation as per the allocation made by the Central Government. 

 

## Regulatory body that governs the generation and transmission of electricity in Goa 

Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission for the state of Goa and Union Territories: Consolidates the laws relating to generation, transmission, distribution, trading and use of electricity and generally for taking measures conducive to development of electricity industry, promoting competition therein, protecting interest of consumers and supply of electricity to all areas, rationalization of electricity tariff, ensuring transparent policies regarding subsidies, promotion of efficient and environmentally benign policies, constitution of Central Electricity Authority, Regulatory Commissions and establishment of Appellate Tribunal and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto, The Electricity Act 2003 was enacted by Government of India. 

The Commission is a two-member body designated to function as an autonomous authority responsible for regulation of the power sector in the state of Goa and Union Territories of Andaman & Nicobar, Lakshadweep, Chandigarh, Daman & Diu, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Puducherry. The powers and the functions of the Commission are as prescribed in the Electricity Act 2003. 

 

## List down at least two rules/ regulations that should be considered while recommending the solution. 

A table of electricity and energy

Description automatically generated 

 

Electricity Supply Code Regulations, 2018 5.26 - The Licensee shall also provide new avenues for applying for new connection or modification in existing connection through website, call centres, etc., which minimize the applicantâ€™s interface with the utility during the process.
